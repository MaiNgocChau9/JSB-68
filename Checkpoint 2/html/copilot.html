        I've been using a work laptop with a dedicated Microsoft Copilot key for
        months now — and it's made me realize one thing
      </h1>
      <img

      <p>
        When Microsoft Copilot was first announced back in September 2023, I,
        like many other observers in the technology world, was excited to see
        what it could do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Offering an AI-boosted way to get exactly the information or help you
        require whenever you need it, launched with just the press of a
        dedicated Copilot button (the first major change to the Windows keyboard
        layout in years) the tool potentially offered a breakthrough for my
        often manic and chaotic working day.
      </p>
      <p>
        So when given the chance to review the HP Envy x360 14-fc009na, one of
        the company's first Copilot-enabled business laptops, I jumped at the
        chance - so how much did Copilot change my working life?
      </p>
      <h3>Go go Copilot?</h3>
      <img
        src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7E2sb3x8Jzuwc2TxuuHDMn-1200-80.jpg.webp"
        alt=""
      />
      <p>In short - not much.</p>
      <p>
        In fact, to begin with, it was a slight annoyance - the new dedicated
        Copilot key on the keyboard layout was the victim of more than a few
        accidental presses as I got used to my new device.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I remembered it was there, I would try and utilize Copilot the best
        I could, primarily for tracking down specific work documents, or finding
        information on an event we had held last year, in preparation for this
        year's event.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was fine - but there were often hiccups with finding information or
        documents within Google Drive (the primary system we use here across
        Future PLC) - and needing to sign in with a Microsoft 365 account to get
        more detailed answers was a bit of a roadblock.
